# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

## üîê Environment Variables

### Stripe Payment Integration

The following environment variables are required for Stripe payment integration:

```bash
# Stripe API Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...                    # Your Stripe secret key (test or live)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...                  # Webhook signing secret from Stripe Dashboard

# Payment Configuration
BOOKING_AMOUNT=10000                              # Default booking amount in cents (10000 = $100.00)
STRIPE_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT=10                   # Platform commission percentage (10 = 10%)
DEFAULT_CURRENCY=usd                              # Default payment currency (usd, eur, etc.)

# Payment URLs (for mobile app deep links or web redirects)
STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL=https://yourapp.com/booking-success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
STRIPE_CANCEL_URL=https://yourapp.com/booking-cancelled

# Frontend URL (for Stripe Connect onboarding redirects)
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourapp.com                 # Base URL of your frontend application

# Required for Stripe Connect
# Artists need to create their Stripe Connect accounts via GraphQL API
# See docs/STRIPE_CONNECT_ONBOARDING.md for details
```

### Stripe Connect Setup

1. **Create a Stripe Connect Platform Account**: [Stripe Connect Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)
2. **Configure Webhook Endpoint**: Add `https://your-api-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe` in Stripe Dashboard
3. **Enable Required Webhook Events**:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
   - `account.updated` (for Stripe Connect onboarding status)

### Artist Onboarding

Artists must complete Stripe Connect onboarding before receiving payments:

1. **Artist calls GraphQL mutation** `createStripeOnboardingUrl`
2. **System creates Stripe Connect account** (if new)
3. **Artist redirected to Stripe** to complete onboarding
4. **Artist provides bank details** and identity verification
5. **Stripe webhook notifies system** when onboarding complete
6. **System updates** `payoutsEnabled: true` ‚Üí artist can receive payments

See [Stripe Connect Onboarding Guide](./docs/STRIPE_CONNECT_ONBOARDING.md) for details.

### Payment Flow

1. **Guest creates booking** ‚Üí Calls `POST /api/bookings/:id/create-payment` or GraphQL `createBookingPayment`
2. **System creates Stripe Checkout Session** with manual capture (pre-authorization)
3. **Guest completes payment** ‚Üí Funds are held (not captured)
4. **Artist accepts booking** ‚Üí Payment is captured, funds transferred to artist's account
5. **Artist rejects booking** ‚Üí Payment is cancelled, funds released
6. **7 days timeout** ‚Üí Automatic cancellation via cron job

### Security & PCI DSS Compliance

- ‚úÖ No card data stored on server
- ‚úÖ Stripe Checkout handles all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Webhook signature verification prevents fraud
- ‚úÖ Pre-authorization prevents unauthorized charges
- ‚úÖ Automatic fund distribution via Stripe Connect
